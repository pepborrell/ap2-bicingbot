# AP2-bicingbot
AP2 project. Telegram's bot for Bicing.

The present Telegram's bot _Inflitrats_BicingBot_ answers textually and graphically (using maps) questions about geometric graphs representing the bicing stations in Barcelona.

## Architecture
The bot has been constitued around a `Graph` type object from the `NetworkX` package and it has two modules:

* `data.py` which contains all the commands to acquire the bicing data, to build the graph and to calculate some interesting features.

* `bot.py` which includes all the commands related to the Telegram's Bot implementation.

## Getting started
The following instructions try to guide you on how to install and make use of the bicingbot.

### Prerequisites
You will find the libraries needed at the requirements.txt file attached in the folder.

### Installing
To install the packages mentioned, simply install them typing:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install them one by one using:
```python
pip install pandas
pip install networkx
pip install haversine
pip install geopy
pip install staticmap
pip install python-telegram-bot==10
```

Please note that in some systems, in order to install packages in `python3` you will have to use `pip3` instead of `pip`.
